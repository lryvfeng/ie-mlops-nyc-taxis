    "## Scenario 1: A single data scientist participating in an ML competition\n",
    "\n",
    "This scenario demonstrates how an individual data scientist can use MLflow to track machine learning experiments on their local machine. This is a common setup for solo projects, hackathons, or competitions where collaboration and remote access are not required.\n",
    "\n",
    "### MLflow setup overview\n",
    "- **Tracking server:** Not used (runs locally, no remote server)\n",
    "- **Backend store:** Local filesystem (stores experiment metadata in the `mlruns/` folder)\n",
    "- **Artifacts store:** Local filesystem (stores model files and other artifacts in the same `mlruns/` folder)\n",
    "\n",
    "With this setup, all experiment runs, parameters, metrics, and artifacts are saved locally. You can explore and compare your experiments using the MLflow UI.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How to use the MLflow UI\n",
    "- You can launch the MLflow UI by running `mlflow ui` in your terminal, or by running the provided code cell in this notebook.\n",
    "- The UI will be available at [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000).\n",
    "- Use the UI to browse experiments, compare runs, and inspect logged models and artifacts.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Tip:** This local setup is ideal for learning and prototyping. For team projects or production, you would typically use a remote tracking server and a more robust backend (e.g., a database and cloud storage)."
